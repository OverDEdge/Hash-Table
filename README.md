# Hash-Table
Python Hash Table Class

The main file hashtable.py contains a HashTable class which can either use the built in hash() function from Python or by using a private function _calc_hash(key). The private function takes the first and last character in the key, adds the Unicode value together and takes the remainder of that value with a chosen table size.
